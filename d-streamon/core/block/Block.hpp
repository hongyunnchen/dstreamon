 *
 * Base class for BlockMon Blocks. A block is a small unit of processing,
 * that comm
 *
 * @section HOW TO BUILD A BLOCK
 *
 * 1. create a subclass of Block ( class MyBlock : public Block { ... }; )
 *    to make it easier on other developers, put this in the blocks/ 
 *    directory, and name it SomethingBlock, unless it meets one of the
 *    following two criteria:
 *    (i)  Messages sources (e.g. IPFIX importers, packet capture blocks)
 *         should be named SomethingSource.
 *    (ii) Message sinks for export (e.g., IPFIX exporters) should be
 *         named SomethingExporter.
 * 2. implement your constructor in terms of the Block constructor. Your
 *    block constructor should take two parameters, std::string name and 
 *    bool active, which will be supplied by BlockFactory. Resource-intensive
 *    initialization can be deferred to _configure(), below.
 * 3. implement the _configure() method to handle block configuration. 
 *    This receives a pugixml node representing the <params> element 
 *    containing block parameters. All blocks must implement _configure(),
 *    which in addition to configuration should also do any necessary
 *    creation of periodic timers or other resource-intensive initialization.
 * 4. implement the _receive_msg() method to receive messages (which you'll
 *    need to do unless your block is a Source).
 * 5. If your block uses timers (see Timer.hpp), implement the _handle_timer() 
 *    method, which gets called when the timers fire.
 * 6. If your block is runtime-reconfigurable, implement the 
 *    _update_config() method.
 * 7. If your block can be passively scheduled and is thread-safe, implement
 *    the _synchronize_access() method to return false. _synchronize_access()
 *    is called after _configure(), so your block's thread-safety can be 
 *    configuration dependent.
 * 8. If your block can only be actively scheduled, and requires
 *    high frequency periodic events without timing constraings (e.g., as
 *    a Source block busywaiting on packets, implement _do_async_processing().
 *    This method should do the smallest amount of processing that is
 *    practical, in order to retain scheduling flexibility.
 * 9. Use the REGISTER_BLOCK(classname, configname) macro at the end of your 
 *    SomethingBlock.cpp file macro to register your Block with the factory.
 *
 * Block scheduling
 * =============================
 * Blockmon supports active and passive block invocation. Active blocks are
 * called by Blockmonâ€™s scheduler, while passive blocks are activated directly
 * within the same thread as the block which sends them a message. Blocks can
 * also be scheduled to run on a timer.
